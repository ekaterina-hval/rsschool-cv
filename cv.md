### About Me
---
I am 30 years old. I worked as an accountant for most of my career. This year I have got a degree of translator in the field of business communication. At the present time I'm trying to break into the IT field. I am glad to start studying at RS school to understand whether front-end development is suitable for me, as well as development in general. I am also interested in system analysis, I am actively looking for ways to study it. I reckon it is significant to get as more insights from different IT perspectives as possible. I hope my attentiveness and perseverance will accompany in getting this new knowledge!
